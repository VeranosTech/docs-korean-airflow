"Performs checks against Druid. The ``DruidCheckOperator`` expects a sql "

"Given a query like ``SELECT COUNT(*) FROM foo``, it will fail only if the"
" count ``== 0``. You can craft much more complex query that could, for "
"instance, check that the table has the same number of rows as the source "
"table upstream, or that the count of today's partition is greater than "
"yesterday's partition, or that a set of metrics are less than 3 standard "
"deviation for the 7 day average. This operator can be used as a data "
"quality check in your pipeline, and depending on where you put it in your"
" DAG, you have the choice to stop the critical path, preventing from "
"publishing dubious data, or on the side and receive email alerts without "
"stopping the progress of the DAG."
