"Moves data from Vertica to Hive. The operator runs your query against "
"Vertica, stores the file locally before loading it into a Hive table. If "
"the ``create`` or ``recreate`` arguments are set to ``True``, a ``CREATE "
"TABLE`` and ``DROP TABLE`` statements are generated. Hive data types are "
"inferred from the cursor's metadata. Note that the table generated in "
"Hive uses ``STORED AS textfile`` which isn't the most efficient "
"serialization format. If a large amount of data is loaded and/or if the "
"table gets queried considerably, you may want to use this operator only "
"to stage the data into a temporary table before loading it into its final"
" destination using a ``HiveOperator``."
