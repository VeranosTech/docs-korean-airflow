"The destination name of the object in the destination Google cloud "
"storage bucket. (templated) If a wildcard is supplied in the "
"source_object argument, this is the prefix that will be prepended to the "
"final destination objects' paths. Note that the source path's part before"
" the wildcard will be removed; if it needs to be retained it should be "
"appended to destination_object. For example, with prefix ``foo/*`` and "
"destination_object ``blah/``, the file ``foo/baz`` will be copied to "
"``blah/baz``; to retain the prefix write the destination_object as e.g. "
"``blah/foo``, in which case the copied file will be named "
"``blah/foo/baz``."
