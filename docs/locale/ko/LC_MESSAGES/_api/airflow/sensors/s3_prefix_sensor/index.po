"Waits for a prefix to exist. A prefix is the first part of a key, thus "
"enabling checking of constructs similar to glob airfl* or SQL LIKE "
"'airfl%'. There is the possibility to precise a delimiter to indicate the"
" hierarchy or keys, meaning that the match will stop at that delimiter. "
"Current code accepts sane delimiters, i.e. characters that are NOT "
"special characters in the Python regex engine."
