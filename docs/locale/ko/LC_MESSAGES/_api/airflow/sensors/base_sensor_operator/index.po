"How the sensor operates. Options are: ``{ poke | reschedule }``, default "
"is ``poke``. When set to ``poke`` the sensor is taking up a worker slot "
"for its whole execution time and sleeps between pokes. Use this mode if "
"the expected runtime of the sensor is short or if a short poke interval "
"is required. When set to ``reschedule`` the sensor task frees the worker "
"slot when the criteria is not yet met and it's rescheduled at a later "
"time. Use this mode if the expected time until the criteria is met is. "
"The poke interval should be more than one minute to prevent too much load"
" on the scheduler."
