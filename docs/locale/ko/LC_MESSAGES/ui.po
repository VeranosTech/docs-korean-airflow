"The Airflow UI makes it easy to monitor and troubleshoot your data "
"pipelines. Here's a quick overview of some of the features and "
"visualizations you can find in the Airflow UI."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ui.rst:26
msgid "DAGs View"
msgstr ""

#: ../../ui.rst:27
msgid ""
"List of the DAGs in your environment, and a set of shortcuts to useful "
"pages. You can see exactly how many tasks succeeded, failed, or are "
"currently running at a glance."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ui.rst:39
msgid "Tree View"
msgstr ""

#: ../../ui.rst:40
msgid ""
"A tree representation of the DAG that spans across time. If a pipeline is"
" late, you can quickly see where the different steps are and identify the"
" blocking ones."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ui.rst:51
msgid "Graph View"
msgstr ""

#: ../../ui.rst:52
msgid ""
"The graph view is perhaps the most comprehensive. Visualize your DAG's "
"dependencies and their current status for a specific run."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ui.rst:62
msgid "Variable View"
msgstr ""

#: ../../ui.rst:63
msgid ""
"The variable view allows you to list, create, edit or delete the key-"
"value pair of a variable used during jobs. Value of a variable will be "
"hidden if the key contains any words in ('password', 'secret', 'passwd', "
"'authorization', 'api_key', 'apikey', 'access_token') by default, but can"
" be configured to show in clear-text."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ui.rst:75
msgid "Gantt Chart"
msgstr ""

#: ../../ui.rst:76
msgid ""
"The Gantt chart lets you analyse task duration and overlap. You can "
"quickly identify bottlenecks and where the bulk of the time is spent for "
"specific DAG runs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ui.rst:87
msgid "Task Duration"
msgstr ""

#: ../../ui.rst:88
msgid ""
"The duration of your different tasks over the past N runs. This view lets"
" you find outliers and quickly understand where the time is spent in your"
" DAG over many runs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ui.rst:100
msgid "Code View"
msgstr ""

#: ../../ui.rst:101
msgid ""
"Transparency is everything. While the code for your pipeline is in source"
" control, this is a quick way to get to the code that generates the DAG "
"and provide yet more context."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ui.rst:112
msgid "Task Instance Context Menu"
msgstr ""

#: ../../ui.rst:113
msgid ""
"From the pages seen above (tree view, graph view, gantt, ...), it is "
"always possible to click on a task instance, and get to this rich context"
" menu that can take you to more detailed metadata, and perform some "
"actions."
