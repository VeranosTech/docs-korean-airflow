"If you want to take a real test drive of Airflow, you should consider "
"setting up a real database backend and switching to the LocalExecutor."

"As Airflow was built to interact with its metadata using the great "
"SqlAlchemy library, you should be able to use any database backend "
"supported as a SqlAlchemy backend. We recommend using **MySQL** or "
"**Postgres**."

"We rely on more strict ANSI SQL settings for MySQL in order to have sane "
"defaults. Make sure to have specified `explicit_defaults_for_timestamp=1`"
" in your my.cnf under `[mysqld]`"

#: ../../howto/initialize-database.rst:32
msgid ""
"If you decide to use **Postgres**, we recommend using the ``psycopg2`` "
"driver and specifying it in your SqlAlchemy connection string. (I.e., "
"``postgresql+psycopg2://<user>:<password>@<host>/<db>``.) Also note that "
"since SqlAlchemy does not expose a way to target a specific schema in the"
" Postgres connection URI, you may want to set a default schema for your "
"role with a command similar to ``ALTER ROLE username SET search_path = "
"airflow, foobar;``"

msgid ""
"Once you've setup your database to host Airflow, you'll need to alter the"
" SqlAlchemy connection string located in your configuration file "
"``$AIRFLOW_HOME/airflow.cfg``. You should then also change the "
"\"executor\" setting to use \"LocalExecutor\", an executor that can "
"parallelize task instances locally."
