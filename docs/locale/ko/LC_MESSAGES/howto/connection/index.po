" a URI format (e.g.``postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/master`` or "

" in the scheme part of URI, so it must be changed to a hyphen character "
"(e.g. `google-compute-platform` if `conn_type` is "
"`google_compute_platform`). Query parameters are parsed to one-"
"dimensional dict and then used to fill extra."
