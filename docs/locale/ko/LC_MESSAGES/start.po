"Upon running these commands, Airflow will create the ``$AIRFLOW_HOME`` "
"folder and lay an \"airflow.cfg\" file with defaults that get you going "
"fast. You can inspect the file either in ``$AIRFLOW_HOME/airflow.cfg``, "
"or through the UI in the ``Admin->Configuration`` menu. The PID file for "
"the webserver will be stored in ``$AIRFLOW_HOME/airflow-webserver.pid`` "
"or in ``/run/airflow/webserver.pid`` if started by systemd."

"Out of the box, Airflow uses a sqlite database, which you should outgrow "
"fairly quickly since no parallelization is possible using this database "
"backend. It works in conjunction with the "
":class:`airflow.executors.sequential_executor.SequentialExecutor` which "
"will only run task instances sequentially. While this is very limiting, "
"it allows you to get up and running quickly and take a tour of the UI and"
" the command line utilities."
